# Steve_GANson
This is a HackRPI 2019 Project! Myself and William He (hew7) are making a GAN using TensorFlow in order to make our own Security Now! podcast episode. Samad loves Security Now, and the namesake of the project is one of the hosts, Steve Gibson. Samad just thought adding GAN to his name is cool.

# Technologies Used

We are developing technologies because Will wanted to do a project and Samad wanted to use TensorFlow.

The following are used in the project: 
* Python3 
* TensorFlow
